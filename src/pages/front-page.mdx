# What is Specky

Specky is the package manager for the age of the Agentic (Vibe) Coder.

# Why Specky?

Now that we can use AI to generate all our applications, the **big pain** is writing PRDs (Product Requirement Documents). 
You have to sit there like a chump and think about all the **requirements and edge cases** of
the various **components** so your Agent doesn't go off and make random decisions for you. 
It takes forever!

Well, what if some other chump already thought about the requirements you're working on?
You could **reuse** those requirements and save yourself a lot of time and trouble!

Specky makes it easy to share requirements so you can quickly build a reliable PRD.

# How Specky Works

Here's what a Specky application/project looks like:

- you use the Specky CLI (spm) to install dependencies from the Specky registry in the `components` directory
- you define the specifications for the app you're building in the `app` directory, which has the same structure as a components
- once you're finished defining the specification for your app, you use `specky spec` to generate a detailed PRD and instructions for your Agent coder
- tell the Agent to execute the instructions in `@instructions.md`

# Why Specky Matters

There’s a reason business analysts exist. Business processes and rules often require specialist knowledge that the average developer doesn’t have. 
Are you aware of the rules for creating invoices in Liechtenstein? Do you know how procurement approvals work in a multinational corporation? 
What about which data privacy constraints apply in regulated industries?

Specky makes it possible to share and reuse a vast ocean of domain specific knowledge that was previously locked in the heads of experts.

# What's up with the name?

- Spec is short for "specification". 
- Speck is German for bacon. 
- Everyone loves bacon. 
- I thought it would be funny. 
- Pleaes excuse my strange sense of humor.
