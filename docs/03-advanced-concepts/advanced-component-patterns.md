# Advanced Component Patterns

As you become more experienced with Specky, you'll want to explore advanced patterns for creating more sophisticated and reusable component specifications. This guide covers advanced techniques and patterns to help you create high-quality, maintainable component specifications.

## Composable Components

### What Are Composable Components?

Composable components are specifications designed to work together through well-defined interfaces. They follow the principle of "composition over inheritance," allowing you to build complex systems from simpler parts.

### Creating Composable Components

To create composable components:

1. **Define clear interfaces**: Specify how components interact with each other
2. **Minimize dependencies**: Reduce coupling between components
3. **Focus on single responsibility**: Each component should do one thing well

#### Example: Payment Processing System

```
payment-system/
├── payment-processor/
│   ├── spec.json
│   ├── component.md
│   └── datamodel.json
├── payment-gateway/
│   ├── spec.json
│   ├── component.md
│   └── datamodel.json
└── payment-methods/
    ├── credit-card/
    │   ├── spec.json
    │   ├── component.md
    │   └── datamodel.json
    ├── bank-transfer/
    │   ├── spec.json
    │   ├── component.md
    │   └── datamodel.json
    └── digital-wallet/
        ├── spec.json
        ├── component.md
        └── datamodel.json
```

In this example:
- Each component has a specific responsibility
- Components can be used independently or together
- The system can be extended with new payment methods without changing the core

## Extensible Components

### What Are Extensible Components?

Extensible components are designed to be enhanced or modified without changing their core functionality. They provide "extension points" where additional behavior can be added.

### Creating Extensible Components

To create extensible components:

1. **Identify extension points**: Determine where customization might be needed
2. **Document extension mechanisms**: Clearly specify how extensions should be implemented
3. **Provide examples**: Show how to create extensions

#### Example: Authentication Component with Extension Points

In your `component.md`:

```markdown
# Authentication Component

## Extension Points

### Custom Authentication Providers

The component supports adding custom authentication providers beyond the built-in ones (username/password, OAuth).

A custom authentication provider must:
1. Implement the AuthProvider interface
2. Handle authentication requests
3. Return standardized user information
4. Manage its own configuration

Example implementation areas:
- Biometric authentication
- Hardware token authentication
- Organization-specific SSO

### Authentication Events

The component emits events at key points in the authentication process that can be subscribed to:

- `pre-authentication`: Before authentication attempt
- `authentication-success`: After successful authentication
- `authentication-failure`: After failed authentication
- `logout`: When a user logs out

Extensions can subscribe to these events to implement custom behavior such as:
- Advanced logging
- Security monitoring
- User analytics
```

## Versioned Components

### What Are Versioned Components?

Versioned components use semantic versioning to manage changes and ensure compatibility. They provide clear upgrade paths and backward compatibility guarantees.

### Creating Versioned Components

To create versioned components:

1. **Follow semantic versioning**: Use MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format
2. **Document breaking changes**: Clearly identify what changes between versions
3. **Provide migration guides**: Help users upgrade between versions

#### Example: Versioning in spec.json

```json
{
  "name": "user-component",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "description": "User management component",
  "changelog": {
    "2.0.0": {
      "breaking": [
        "Changed user authentication flow to support multi-factor authentication",
        "Renamed 'role' attribute to 'roles' and changed to array type"
      ],
      "features": [
        "Added support for multi-factor authentication",
        "Added support for multiple user roles"
      ],
      "fixes": [
        "Fixed validation for email addresses"
      ]
    },
    "1.1.0": {
      "features": [
        "Added support for user preferences"
      ],
      "fixes": [
        "Improved password strength validation"
      ]
    },
    "1.0.0": {
      "initial": "Initial release"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Example: Migration Guide in component.md

```markdown
## Migration Guide

### Migrating from v1.x to v2.0

#### Authentication Flow Changes

The authentication flow now supports multi-factor authentication:

**v1.x Authentication Flow:**
1. User provides username/password
2. System validates credentials
3. User is authenticated

**v2.0 Authentication Flow:**
1. User provides username/password
2. System validates primary credentials
3. If MFA is enabled, system requests secondary factor
4. User provides secondary factor
5. System validates secondary factor
6. User is authenticated

#### Role Attribute Changes

The `role` attribute has been renamed to `roles` and changed to an array type:

**v1.x Role Structure:**
```json
{
  "role": "admin"
}
```

**v2.0 Roles Structure:**
```json
{
  "roles": ["admin", "editor"]
}
```
```

## Configurable Components

### What Are Configurable Components?

Configurable components allow users to customize behavior without modifying the specification. They define configuration options and how they affect component behavior.

### Creating Configurable Components

To create configurable components:

1. **Define configuration options**: Specify what can be configured
2. **Provide defaults**: Set reasonable default values
3. **Document effects**: Explain how each option affects behavior

#### Example: Configurable Authentication Component

In your `component.md`:

```markdown
# Authentication Component

## Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `passwordPolicy.minLength` | integer | 8 | Minimum password length |
| `passwordPolicy.requireSpecialChars` | boolean | true | Require special characters in passwords |
| `passwordPolicy.requireNumbers` | boolean | true | Require numbers in passwords |
| `passwordPolicy.requireUppercase` | boolean | true | Require uppercase letters in passwords |
| `sessionDuration` | integer | 3600 | Session duration in seconds |
| `maxLoginAttempts` | integer | 5 | Maximum failed login attempts before account lockout |
| `lockoutDuration` | integer | 1800 | Account lockout duration in seconds |
| `mfaEnabled` | boolean | false | Enable multi-factor authentication |
| `allowedMfaMethods` | array | ["sms", "email", "app"] | Allowed MFA methods |

### Configuration Effects

#### Password Policy

The password policy configuration affects:
- User registration validation
- Password change validation
- Password strength indicators

Example: If `passwordPolicy.requireSpecialChars` is set to `false`, passwords without special characters will be accepted.

#### Session Management

The `sessionDuration` setting controls how long a user session remains valid after authentication.

Example: If `sessionDuration` is set to `86400`, user sessions will remain valid for 24 hours.
```

## Specialized Component Types

### Domain-Specific Components

Domain-specific components focus on particular business domains with specialized terminology and concepts.

#### Example: E-commerce Product Catalog Component

```markdown
# Product Catalog Component

## Domain Concepts

### Product
A sellable item with attributes like SKU, name, description, price, etc.

### Category
A grouping of related products in a hierarchical structure.

### Variant

### Cross-Cutting Components

Cross-cutting components address concerns that span multiple components, such as logging, security, or monitoring.

#### Example: Logging Component

```markdown
