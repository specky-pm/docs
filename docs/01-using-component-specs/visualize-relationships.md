# Visualize Component Relationships

Understanding how components relate to each other is crucial for managing complex projects. Specky provides powerful visualization tools to help you see these relationships clearly. This guide will show you how to visualize component relationships using the `spm viz` command.

## Why Visualize Component Relationships?

Visualizing component relationships helps you:
- Understand dependencies between components
- Identify potential architectural issues
- Plan refactoring or updates
- Communicate your architecture to stakeholders
- Document your system design

## Basic Visualization

To generate a basic visualization of your component relationships, navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
spm viz
```

This command analyzes your project and its dependencies, then generates a visualization showing how components are connected.

By default, the visualization is displayed in your default browser as an interactive diagram.

## Visualization Formats

Specky supports multiple output formats for visualizations:

### SVG Format

```bash
spm viz --format=svg
```

This creates an SVG file that you can view in any browser or SVG viewer. SVG files are ideal for including in documentation.

### PNG Format

```bash
spm viz --format=png
```

This creates a PNG image file, which is useful for presentations or sharing with tools that don't support SVG.

### JSON Format

```bash
spm viz --format=json
```

This outputs the relationship data as JSON, which you can use to create custom visualizations or integrate with other tools.

### DOT Format

```bash
spm viz --format=dot
```

This outputs the graph in DOT format, which can be used with Graphviz and other graph visualization tools.

## Customizing Visualizations

### Controlling Depth

By default, `spm viz` shows all dependencies at all levels. You can limit the depth to make the visualization more manageable:

```bash
spm viz --depth=2
```

This shows only direct dependencies and their immediate dependencies (two levels deep).

### Focusing on Specific Components

To focus on a specific component and its relationships:

```bash
spm viz --focus=user-component
```

This centers the visualization on the specified component, showing its dependencies and the components that depend on it.

### Highlighting Relationships

To highlight specific types of relationships:

```bash
spm viz --highlight=direct-dependencies
```

Options include:
- `direct-dependencies`: Components your project directly depends on
- `indirect-dependencies`: Dependencies of your dependencies
- `dependents`: Components that depend on your components
- `conflicts`: Components with version conflicts

### Styling the Visualization

You can customize the appearance of your visualization:

```bash
spm viz --theme=dark
```

Available themes include:
- `light` (default)
- `dark`
- `colorblind`
- `minimal`

## Saving Visualizations

To save the visualization to a file:

```bash
spm viz --format=svg --output=component-diagram.svg
```

This saves the visualization to the specified file instead of displaying it in the browser.

## Advanced Visualization Features

### Interactive Mode

The default browser visualization is interactive, allowing you to:
- Zoom in and out
- Drag components to rearrange them
- Click on components to see details
- Filter the view dynamically

### Analyzing Specific Aspects

You can create specialized visualizations:

#### Version Conflicts

```bash
spm viz --analyze=conflicts
```

This highlights components with version conflicts in your dependency tree.

#### Dependency Impact

```bash
spm viz --analyze=impact --component=auth-component
```

This shows what would be affected if you updated the specified component.

#### Unused Dependencies

```bash
spm viz --analyze=unused
```

This highlights dependencies that aren't actually used by your components.

## Integrating Visualizations into Documentation

Visualizations are valuable additions to your project documentation. Here's how to include them:

1. Generate a static visualization:
```bash
spm viz --format=svg --output=docs/images/component-diagram.svg
```

2. Include it in your markdown documentation:
```markdown
# System Architecture

Below is the component relationship diagram for our system:

![Component Diagram](./images/component-diagram.svg)
```

## Visualization Best Practices

1. **Keep it focused**: Use `--depth` and `--focus` to create targeted visualizations
2. **Update regularly**: Regenerate visualizations when your dependencies change
3. **Use appropriate formats**: Choose SVG for documentation, PNG for presentations
4. **Add context**: Include explanations with your visualizations
5. **Consider your audience**: Simplify visualizations for non-technical stakeholders

## Troubleshooting Visualizations

### Too Many Components

If your visualization is too cluttered:
- Reduce the depth: `spm viz --depth=1`
- Focus on a specific component: `spm viz --focus=main-component`
- Group related components: `spm viz --group=functional-area`

### Missing Dependencies

If dependencies aren't showing up:
- Ensure they're properly installed: `spm install`
- Check for circular dependencies: `spm viz --analyze=circular`
- Validate your specifications: `spm validate`

## Next Steps

Now that you know how to visualize component relationships, you can:
- [Search for specifications](./search-specifications.md) to enhance your architecture
- [Update specifications](./update-specifications.md) to resolve issues identified in visualizations
- [Manage configuration](./configuration-management.md) to customize Specky for your needs
